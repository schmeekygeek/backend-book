# Communication Protocols
Suppose you wanted to help an old woman at the supermarket in carrying some stuff. So you ask her so politely, but to your surprise, she doesn't speak the same language as you!

```

In order to verbally communicate with a person effectively, it is necessary that they speak the same language as you do for information to be exchanged successfully.
