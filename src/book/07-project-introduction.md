\part{Building WhisperChat}
# Project Introduction and Setup
WhisperChat, the project that we'll build in this book together, is going to be the server for a simple texting platform that will allow users to communicate or chat with someone in their preferred vicinity or range. The goal of this project is to help you understand how certain backend applications usually work. I would rate this project a bit easier than building REST APIs that implement CRUD operations. 

## What you need:
We will aim to keep things simple throughout the project and use as less tools and dependencies as possible.
