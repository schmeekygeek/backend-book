# Introduction
***Backend Development for Beginners (using Golang)*** is a book that teaches you about the fundamentals of backend development using Golang.
This book assumes no prior knowledge of backend development but requires that you have some programming experience.

It consists of three parts: The first part contains fundamental concepts that you need to know as a backend developer, the second part is a short introduction to the Go programming language.
And the third part contains a small e-commerce backend application that we will be building with Go.
I will walk you through every part of the project, explaining things along the way.
But you need to follow along and type with me in order to get the most value out of this book.

## Who this book is for
This book is for anyone who is willing to learn and get into backend development.
People switching careers from frontend development will also find this book a great starting guide to get into the field.

With concepts explained such as HTTP, JSON, authentication and authorisation, CRUD and others, it will give you a well-rounded introduction to backend development along with best practices and tips to build solid, performant and secure backend applications in Go.

If you're a backend developer already, this book can also be used to brush up on some concepts, say, before an interview, as well.
