# Introduction
***Backend Development Diluted*** is a book that teaches you about the fundamentals of backend development using Golang.

This book assumes no prior knowledge of backend development but requires that you have some programming experience.

It consists of two parts: The first part contains fundamental concepts that you need to know as a backend developer, and the second part contains a small e-commerce backend application that we will be building with Go alongwith a short introduction to Go itself.
I will walk you through every part of the project in the third part, explaining things along the way,
but you need to follow along and type with me in order to get the most value out of this book. The code for part II will be in the `src/code/` directory of the repository `https://github.com/schmeekygeek/backend-book.` 
By the end of it all, you'll have many concepts pertaining to backend development understood, and a shiny new project to show off in front of your friends! ***(Heck yeah!)***.

I have tried my best to not include superfluous details about everything, much of which will be easy to understand with just a little research on your own. This book aims to take away the overwhelm that many beginners face and give you a headstart on your journey.

## Who this book is for
This book is for anyone who is willing to learn and get into backend development.
People switching careers may also find this book a great starting guide to get into the field.

With concepts explained such as HTTP, JSON, authentication and authorisation, CRUD and others, it will give you a well-rounded introduction to backend development along with best practices and tips to build solid, performant and secure backend applications in Go.

If you're a backend developer already, this book can also be used to brush up on some concepts, say, before an interview, as well.
