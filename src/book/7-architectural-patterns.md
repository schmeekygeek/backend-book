# Architectural Patterns
An application that consists of three parts: The UI, the backend and the database, is known as a 3-tier application.

## 3-tier applications
3-tier applications are the simplest example of a modern-day, full-stack application. The user pushes a button on a mobile app, it triggers a request to the server, the server reads or writes from the database, depending on the request and returns a response that is displayed by the mobile app.
