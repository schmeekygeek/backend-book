# Authentication and Authorisation

Authentication and Authorisation are the one of the most fundamental concepts in securing APIs. They are often used interchangeably, but they are two very different terms. Let's look at an example to try and understand them:

// example

Authentication is the process of determining if a person is the same as the one he is claiming to be.

Authorisation is the process of determining if a person is allowed to perform a particular action or not.

So, in other words,

**Authentication** | *Are you really X? Prove it.*
-------------    --------------------------
**Authorisation** | *Are you allowed to do X?*
