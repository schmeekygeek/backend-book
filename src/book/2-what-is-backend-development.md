# What is Backend Development
Consider this analogy: You go to a restaurant, the waiter greets you, then sits you at a table. He then brings you a menu for you to decide what you want to eat. You spend some time dilly-dallying, overthinking before finally deciding to go with something basic as noodles. The waiter gives you a look of disappointment, writes down your order, then disappears.

He comes back after some time to give you saddening news that the restaurant is out of noodles and asks if you would like some rice instead. You agree and then he disappears again. He comes back after sometime to serve you your desired rice.
