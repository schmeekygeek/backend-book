\part{Project BlogSpace}

# Project Outline
*BlogSpace* is a simple blogging platform that we will be building together in this book. Building a project after you've learnt some concepts is a great way to cement the knowledge and grok the true meaning and purpose of a concept inside your mind. We are going to build *BlogSpace* step-by-step, covering each detail, feature implementation and code, line-by-line. Most of the endpoints that we'll build, will be simple CRUD operations so that you pick them up easily. Note that we won't be building the frontend of the entire application as that is beyond the scope of this book. However, we will be testing and trying out our application's API endpoints using tools such as *Postman* (An API testing application) and `curl`. Let's go over the features that we will be implementing in *BlogSpace.* 

## Features
- **User login and signup** - We'll implement the total flow of creating
  a user account using details such as email, verifying the email of the
  account and adding login. Before the user is logged in and their email is verified, we will reject all requests from them.
- **Creating blog posts** - We will allow users to write as many blogs as they would like.
- **Like blog posts** - Blog posts can be liked by another user other than the author himself.
- **Search for blogs** - We will do keyword matching and search blog posts for the user.
- **Delete blog posts** - Blog posts can be deleted by the author of the post.
