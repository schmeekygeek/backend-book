# Who this book is for
This book is for anyone who is willing to learn and get into backend development. It assumes no prior knowledge of backend development but requires you to have some programming experience. People switching careers from frontend development will also find this book a great starting guide to get into the field.

With concepts explained such as HTTP, JSON, authentication and authorisation, CRUD and others, it will give you a well-rounded introduction to backend development along with best practices and tips to build solid, performant and secure backend applications in Go.

If you're a backend developer already, this book can also be used to brush up on some concepts, say, before an interview, as well.

```golang
